# Automatic Simulation Tool for MassMotion
This tool, which is built on MassMotion SDK, can perform several types of simulation tasks below:
- Run a given number of simulations based on one single set of parameters.
- Run simulations when inputs are randomly sampled in a given space.
- Run simulations based on a given list of inputs.

It acts as a supporting tool of my [Master thesis](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Travel-Efficiency-Evaluation-in-Transforming-Train-Stations) where I tried exploring impacts of several external factors on travel efficiency in train stations.\
The application of this tool can be found in [this conference paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350810067_Sensitivity_Analysis_of_Pedestrian_Simulation_on_Train_Station_Platforms).
## Installation
- MassMotion 10.6.4 with its Python SDK
- Python 3.4 (other versions are not compatible with the MassMotion above)
- no other additional packages required
